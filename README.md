## Installing

make sure you are using python 3.8

`python3 --version`

install required packages

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

Call python-spectrum like so:

`python3 main.py {Device Name}`

where `{Device Name}` is a substring of the audio device audio is to be captured from. I use the program [Background Music](https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic) on my macbook and set `{Device Name}` to `Background`
